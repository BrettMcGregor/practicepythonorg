"""
In the previous exercise we saved information about famous scientistsâ€™ names
and birthdays to disk. In this exercise, load that JSON file from disk, extract
the months of all the birthdays, and count how many scientists have a birthday
in each month.

Your program should output something like:

{
	"May": 3,
	"November": 2,
	"December": 1
}
