"""
This exercise is Part 1 of 4 of the birthday data exercise series. 

For this exercise, we will keep track of when our friendâ€™s birthdays are, and be able to
find that information based on their name. Create a dictionary (in your file) of names and
birthdays. When you run your program it should ask the user to enter a name, and return
the birthday of that person back to them. The interaction should look something like this:

>>> Welcome to the birthday dictionary. We know the birthdays of:
Albert Einstein
Benjamin Franklin
Ada Lovelace
>>> Who's birthday do you want to look up?
Benjamin Franklin
>>> Benjamin Franklin's birthday is 01/17/1706.

Happy coding!
